**Note**: You might notice a lack of diversity in this list. However, we feel that having fewer well-supported options is better than having a broad list of options, which involve a lot of modifications to the system and yet may still result in not being able to achieve a good experience.

#### Post Setup
Now that you followed the setup guide for your distro, check out the [**Post-Setup Page**](post-setup.md) for more info on configuration.


<br>


#### Run the games
Open up a terminal and then run the following command. Please edit where appropriate.



- Using sh instead of bash does not work. Only use bash or ./ with x permission.


```
bash /Path/to/Game/start.{n/e-w/n-w}.sh
```

**Or you could add them to your game launcher**. Such as [Heroic Games Launcher](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/).


You just need to treat the releases as 'native/linux' so that the launcher asks you to point to a 'linux executable'.


Which the start script is, if you checked the executable permission in properties.
